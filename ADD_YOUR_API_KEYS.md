# ðŸ”‘ How to Add Your API Keys to Culture Radar

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open the `.env` file
Located at: `/root/culture-radar/.env`

### Step 2: Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys

Find these lines and replace with your keys:
```env
# Replace THIS:
OPENAGENDA_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAGENDA_KEY_HERE

# With your actual key:
OPENAGENDA_API_KEY=abc123your-real-key-here
```

### Step 3: Save the file

### Step 4: Test your APIs
Run this command:
```bash
php setup-apis.php
```

## Your API Keys Should Look Like:

### OpenAgenda
```env
OPENAGENDA_API_KEY=5a7b9c2d4e6f8g1h3i5j7k9l
```

### OpenWeatherMap
```env
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

### Google Maps
```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyB1234567890abcdefghijklmnop
```

### Mapbox (optional)
```env
MAPBOX_API_KEY=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91cnVzZXJuYW1lIiwiYSI6ImNrMTIzNDU2Nzg5MGFiY2RlZmdoaWprbG1ub3BxcnN0dXZ3eHl6In0.abc123
```

## Example Complete .env File:

APP_URL=http://localhost:8888

# Database Configuration

# Your Real API Keys
OPENAGENDA_API_KEY=5a7b9c2d4e6f8g1h3i5j7k9l
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6

```

## After Adding Your Keys:

1. **Test the APIs:**
   ```bash
   php setup-apis.php
   ```
   This will:
   - Verify each API key works
   - Import real events from OpenAgenda
   - Test weather data
   - Check maps functionality

2. **Check the Dashboard:**
   - Visit: http://localhost:8888/dashboard.php
   - You should now see:
     - Real weather data (not "--Â°C")
     - Actual events from OpenAgenda
     - Working maps
     - Location detection

3. **If Something Doesn't Work:**
   - Check the test output for errors
   - Make sure keys are copied correctly (no extra spaces)
   - Verify your API keys are active on their platforms
